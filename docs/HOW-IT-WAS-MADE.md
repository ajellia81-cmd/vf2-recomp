# How Virtua Fighter 2 Recomp was made

This is a write-up of how the port was built and checked: what is recompiled, what comes from MAME, and how AI coding
tools were used. The commit history has the detail; this is the overview.

## The approach

Virtua Fighter 2 (1994) runs on Sega's Model 2A board. The game logic is a program for the main CPU, an Intel i960.
Around that CPU are a Fujitsu MB86234 DSP that does the geometry (the TGP), a geometrizer and polygon renderer, the
System 24 tile chip for the 2D layers, an I/O board, and a sound board (a 68000 and a Yamaha SCSP with its own DSP).

**The i960 program is recompiled. The rest of the board is not.** Only the main CPU's program is recompiled. The TGP,
the 3D renderer, the tile chip and the sound board run on code ported from MAME. The i960 only takes about 2 ms of a
frame, so recompiling it isn't about speed. The point is that "recomp" should be literally true of the game's program.

- **The recompiler (`src/rec`).** The port ships an address map, `src/rec/vf2_map.cpp`: where the functions start,
  where the indirect jumps lead, and the program's string thunks. It holds addresses only, no bytes from the ROM. When
  the game starts, it reads the i960 program from the player's `vf2.zip`, finds the code from the map, and turns it
  into ARM64 or x86-64 with SLJIT. The common instructions (loads and stores to plain memory, the ALU, compares and
  branches) become machine instructions. The rest run the interpreter's case for that opcode, with the decoding fixed
  in advance. Time slices end where the interpreter's would, and interrupts and FIFO stalls come where it has them.
  The idle loop skips rounds that only count cycles. If the program is patched at run time, its native code is made
  again.
- **Coverage.** The map was made from coverage runs (`vf2run --cov`, then `make map`): both game versions, 1P,
  versus, the ending, game over and attract. That came to 38,567 instructions run, all of them recompiled.
- **A C++ form for development.** `make rec` also writes the program out as C++ (from your own ROM, into `build/`,
  never committed) for the lockstep checker.
- **The interpreter is kept.** MAME's i960 interpreter is the reference for checking and the fallback.
  `vf2 --interp` runs it.

**From MAME:** the i960 and 68000 cores (unchanged, on a small shim in place of MAME's device framework), the MB86234
core, the geometrizer and renderer, the tile chip, and the SCSP with its DSP. Every file ported from MAME keeps MAME's
licence and copyright-holder lines. `src/machine` holds the board (memory map, interrupts, timers, the TGP glue) as a
standalone runtime: one machine, no other drivers.

**New for the port:** the SDL 3 host in `src/host`. It has the window and controls, an in-game menu (RmlUi), saves,
and these additions to the arcade:

- **Render scale.** The 3D is drawn at 1x to 6x. MAME's polygon setup is kept, and its scan conversion is split into
  row bands across all cores. Both give the same pixels, and 1x is still MAME's picture.
- **Smooth motion.** Up to 120 pictures a second between the game's 57.5 frames. Each object's matrix is blended with
  the same object in the frame before. Objects are paired by model and list order, with the camera's move fitted to
  check the pairing.
- **Widescreen.** In fights the 3D sees further to the sides and the backdrop panorama goes with it. The player select
  gets painted side columns.
- **Antialiasing** (an edge filter, or 2x/3x supersampling), scanlines, and GPU compositing of the 2D and 3D from 2x.
- **Pacing, pipelining and a load governor.** The game runs on its own clock, nudged to keep the sound queued. When
  running a frame and then drawing it no longer fit in a frame's time, each picture is drawn on another thread while
  the next frame runs. If that still isn't enough, the governor turns off antialiasing and then lowers the scale.
- **Scene sync and sound.** Scene changes are held until the new scene is whole. Music and effects have separate
  volumes, and the overall level has a peak limiter.

A GPU renderer for the 3D is in progress on a separate branch. It isn't in the releases.

## How it was checked

Everything is checked against two references: MAME's interpreter, and MAME itself.

- **Lockstep against the interpreter.** `tools/vf2lock.cpp` runs two boards side by side, one on MAME's i960
  interpreter and one on the recompiled code. Per frame, or per time slice for short runs, it compares the CPU's whole
  state, the clocks, the RAMs and the pictures. The C++ form ran 176,000 frames identical. The native form is checked
  over the same scripted runs, on Apple silicon and on x86-64.
- **Frames, RAM and sound against MAME.** From the first boot, the headless runner (`tools/vf2run.cpp`) was compared
  with MAME frame by frame: `tools/compare.py` for the pictures, and NVRAM, backup RAM and EEPROM against what MAME
  saves. Other checks compare the i960's traffic to the TGP word for word, the SCSP's output sample for sample
  (`tools/sound_compare.py`), and 68000 traces (`tools/trace68k_compare.py`). The scripts that take the references from
  MAME need the ROMs, so they aren't in this repo.
- **Scripted, headless runs.** `vf2run --script` plays input scripts (`tools/scripts/`). The same events can be played
  in MAME, so both runs get identical inputs. Options like `--ko` get a script past rounds, and logs cover the sound
  voices, the coprocessor and the pacing.
- **Twin-board picture checks.** These compare pictures drawn by different paths of the same build: pipelined against
  drawn at once, smooth motion at a frame's own moment against the plain frame, redraws, and GPU-composited parts
  against the CPU's. All must match pixel for pixel.
- **Where MAME isn't the arcade.** The game's mix puts its music about 13 dB over the hits. Every gain stage of MAME's
  SCSP was checked against other hardware-tested implementations and the chip's manual, and nothing in the core was
  wrong. So the core stays MAME-exact, and the balance is set by the host's volume defaults, as a stated choice. At
  music 100 and effects 100 the output is MAME's, sample for sample.

## Working with AI

The port was built with Claude, through Claude Code, after the same process on Virtua Fighter 1. In practice:

- **A person directs, tests and decides.** The human side was play-testing on a Mac, Windows and a Steam Deck,
  reporting what looked or sounded wrong (a bush jumping aside, music too loud over the hits), deciding the trade-offs, and
  reviewing what went out. One example: the first builds ran the i960 on MAME's core, and the release waited until the
  recompiler was done so that the name would be accurate.
- **Agents in parallel, all headless.** Several agents worked at once on separate branches and problems. Each had its
  own data folder and ran the game hidden (`VF2_HIDDEN=1`, no window, no Dock icon), never in a visible window on the
  machine the person was using.
- **Measure, don't assume.** Every claim had to come with a number: a lockstep run, a pixel count, a timing, a dB
  figure. Ideas that measured out to nothing were dropped. A "cabinet speaker EQ" for the sound balance moved it by
  under 1 dB, and an option to soften the edges of see-through textures made no difference to the shimmer. Both were
  measured and left out.
- **Memory in the repo.** Sessions don't share memory, so commit messages record what changed, why, and how it was
  checked, and private project notes hold findings and dead ends. A new session reads those instead of rediscovering
  them.

The AI wrote nearly all the code. A person decided what was right.

## Problems worth knowing about

- **A bush jumped aside for one picture every few seconds** → smooth motion paired a bush with the next one of its
  model when the camera turned → runs of one model pair by position, the camera's move is fitted to check pairs, and an
  object still in the world is found where it was.
- **Music drowning the hits** → that's the game's own mix, not an emulation bug → separate music and effects volumes,
  stage ambience moved with the music and crowd roars with the effects, and a leveller on the effects.
- **28 pictures a second for minutes on a slow PC, governor untouched** → two frames a pass made every pass look like
  a scene change, so nothing was judged → a whole busy window short of pictures now counts.
- **Steam Deck dipped as the first fight began** → pipelining only switched on after the governor's window → pipelined
  from the first frame on a Deck, and at the scale where a previous run needed it.
- **Hedges drawn over towers at the far edges of 32:9** → Model 2 sorts a polygon by one depth, taken from an
  off-screen end → polygons seen only in the side columns sort by their on-screen part. The 4:3 part is unchanged.
- **x86-64 pictures a few texels off Apple silicon's** → fused multiply-adds round differently → an exact build flag
  for checking. RAM and registers are identical either way.
- **A crash when the renderer lost its textures** → a device reset (Direct3D) dropped textures still in use → every
  texture is rebuilt after a reset.
- **Waiting through the boot** → the board's warning countdown → the game runs unseen at full speed to the attract,
  and the countdown is cut after a CRC check.

## Where to look

- `src/rec/`: the i960 recompiler (code discovery, SLJIT native code, the C++ form, the runtime).
  `src/rec/vf2_map.cpp` is the address map.
- `tools/vf2lock.cpp`: the lockstep checker. Start here to see what "identical" means.
- `tools/recomp/`, and the Makefile's `map` and `rec` targets: making the map and the C++ form.
- `src/machine/`: the Model 2A board (memory map, timers, TGP glue, renderer, sound, smooth motion).
- `src/host/`: window, pacing, governor, pipelining, scene sync, GPU compositing, the menu.
- `tools/vf2run.cpp`, `tools/scripts/`, `tools/compare.py`, `tools/sound_compare.py`: the headless runner and the
  comparisons with MAME.
- `git log`: each commit message explains what changed, why, and how it was checked.
